            <p>
                A relatively hard, off-white (or orange if colourings are added) cheese. Originating in the English village of Cheddar, it's now the most popular type of cheese in the UK and is produced all over the world. Its flavour sharpens over time as it matures.

                <strong>Origin:</strong> Meaux, France
            </p>
            <p>
                Known as the "Queen of Cheeses", Brie is a soft cow's-milk cheese with a gentle, creamy flavour. It has a bloomy white rind of mould which is considered a delicacy and is perfectly edible. It's perfect on a cracker with grapes!

            <p>
                <strong>Origin:</strong> Gorgonzola, Italy
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a veined Italian blue cheese, made from unskimmed cow's milk. It can be buttery or firm, crumbly and quite salty, with a "bite" from its blue veining. It is often eaten melted into risotto or served with polenta.
